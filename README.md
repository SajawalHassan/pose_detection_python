<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is an **opencv**, **python** and **mediapipe** project that uses open-cv to read the file and mediapipe algorithm to detect the pose of the entity.

This is the kind of technology that snapchat, instagram, apple uses to detect poses. This isn't the most accurate but i would say about 90 percentile of the time it works perfectly.

This is an **opensource** project so if you want to contribute then you can and add your **amazing** features and make pull request.
